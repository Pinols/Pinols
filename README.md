Yo,
I'm Pinols, an italian dude in his mid 20's, passionate about everything technology since i was little.

I have been putting effort in the last year and a half in resuming learning a coding language, specifically Java,
and accomplished becoming an Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer this February.

My Github should be a repository for the projects i made to practice in this period.
